    <h1>Privacy Policy — SG-Bhinneka</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: September 13, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>SG-Bhinneka</strong> ("we", "our", or "the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use the SG-Bhinneka mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information that helps us provide, improve, and personalize the App experience. The categories below summarize the types of data we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> Account information (if any), profile details, feedback, support messages, and any content you submit through the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Automatically collected information:</strong> Device information (device model, operating system, unique device identifiers), usage data (features used, session length, crash reports), and log data.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and diagnostics:</strong> Information collected by analytics services to measure and improve performance and user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional data:</strong> If you choose to provide additional data (for example, an image or optional profile information), we will process that data according to this policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use information for purposes that include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, maintaining, and improving the App and its features.</li>
      <li>Personalizing your experience and delivering content relevant to you.</li>
      <li>Diagnosing technical problems and monitoring performance.</li>
      <li>Responding to user inquiries and providing customer support.</li>
      <li>Protecting against fraud, abuse, and other illegal activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, cloud hosting). These providers are permitted to use your data only as necessary to provide services to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> When required by law, legal process, or government request, or to protect our rights, property, safety, or users.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy—where personal information may be transferred as part of the transaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Analytics and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase) to help analyze usage and improve the App. These services may collect information about your use of the App and other apps and websites. Their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>5. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
    <p>SG-Bhinneka does not display personalized advertising based on sensitive personal data. If the App uses advertising SDKs or non-personalized ads in the future, any data sharing will be disclosed and controlled according to this policy and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>6. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The App may store small amounts of data on your device (e.g., in local storage) to remember settings or preferences. Mobile apps do not use browser cookies in the same way websites do, but may use similar local storage mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the App’s services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When data is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of any data.</p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us and we will take steps to delete the data.</p>

    <h2>10. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing. To exercise these rights or to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, contact us using the information below.</p>

    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data collected by the App may be processed and stored in countries outside your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when transferring data internationally.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will post the updated policy and revise the "Effective date" at the top. Your continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
